# Python workshop

Python library requirements  
* Python version 3.4+ (I would advise an Anaconda python installation)
* Jupyter notebook
* Numpy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas

To setup a Python installation with Anaconda, please follow the guide I've uploaded [here](https://github.com/wajra/python-workshop/blob/master/Installing%20Python%20and%20PyCharm%20sheet.pdf).  
A recording of the workshop can be found at [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SwEw4HC-er85XyeAQpExFZ-trHqmkdwR?usp=sharing) link.  
This is a 1 hour workshop that aims to introduce a user to basic Python as well as a soft introduction to the SciPy ecosystem.  
After going through these notebooks, I would suggest going in depth on specific scientific Python libraries.  
Here are some tutorial for each library I have found useful in the past.  
1. General SciPy - [Shane Neely's walkthrough on Scipy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYTs9HwFGbY)
2. Numpy in depth - [Alex Chabot-Leclerc in SciPy 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB7BZMhfPgk)
3. Matplotlib in depth - [Hannah Aizeman, Thomas Caswell in Scipy 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr4DYo4v5AY)
4. Pandas in depth - [Daniel Chen in SciPy 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rNu16O3YNE)

Also nothing beats going through official documentation for any language or library. 
Wes McKinney's old tutorials are still useful, even though they do show some outdated methods for Pandas. His [book](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython-ebook/dp/B075X4LT6K) is a wonderful introduction to using Python for data analysis.  

Have fun!!!

I present to you the Zen of Python  

**The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters**

Beautiful is better than ugly.  
Explicit is better than implicit.  
Simple is better than complex.  
Complex is better than complicated.  
Flat is better than nested.  
Sparse is better than dense.  
Readability counts.  
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.  
Although practicality beats purity.  
Errors should never pass silently.  
Unless explicitly silenced.  
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.  
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.  
Now is better than never.  
Although never is often better than *right* now.  
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.  
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
